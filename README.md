# MORPH

MORPH is a halo finder that is completely independent
of the gravity model used in the N-body simulations.
MORPH can analyze any dataset from a modified gravity N-body simulation.
This is performed without the need for code modifications to accommodate for the
modified gravity theory.
It uses a modified friends-of-friends algorithm.
